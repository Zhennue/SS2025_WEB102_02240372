# Documentation

## Main Concepts Applied

RESTful API Design: Proper URI naming and HTTP methods.

Express.js Setup: Middleware for security (helmet), logging (morgan), and CORS.

Error Handling: Custom middleware for standardized responses.

Mock Data: Simulated database using mockData.js.

Content Negotiation: Middleware to format responses based on Accept headers.

API Documentation: Simple docs.html file for endpoint reference.


# Reflection

## Learnings

Built a structured RESTful API using Node.js and Express.

Understood middleware usage for security, logging, and error handling.

Improved API response handling with content negotiation.

## Challenges & Solutions

CORS Issues: Fixed using cors middleware.

Unhandled Async Errors: Used an asyncHandler utility.

Content Negotiation: Adjusted middleware to check Accept headers.

## Conclusion

This project enhanced my understanding of RESTful API development, Express.js, and best practices in API structuring.
